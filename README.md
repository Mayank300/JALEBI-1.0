# JALEBI


Jalebi making is an art and the reward you get at the end of it is sweet â€“ quite literally! The crisp sugary spirals taste brilliant served piping hot along with chilled rabdi. Traditionally a muslin cloth with a hole in it is used to make the spirals in hot oil, but using a squeezy bottle makes it much simpler.
